# MyReads Project

This is my project submission for Udacity's MyReads React project, as part of the Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## Getting Started

To install and run the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Authors

Udacity and me, Sebastian Malm.

Udacity provided the majority of the HTML and CSS; I took the static site and made it into an interactive React single page app.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Udacity for providing the instructional material for learning the concepts necessary for this project.
